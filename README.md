# AdminRole

## ! TO RUN THIS PLUGIN YOU NEED TO ALSO ADD LUCKPERMS & (I recommend) EssentialsX, EssentialsX Chat and Vault PLUGINS !

### Commands

/adminmode - you enter the admin mode
 
### How to change Prefix
Do not change the prefix in the plugin's config change it like so:
1. By default do /luckperms group adminmodeprefix meta removeprefix 100
2. Set new Prefix by /luckperms group adminmodeprefix meta setprefix {PrefixName} {priorityValue}

### Change anything in the config
1. Change the things you want.
2. Reload the Plugin using the console or /reload.
If it is does not work, try to reload it twice. When that does not work too, message me.
